# IDW Interpolation 
__Summary:__
The project is based on reading X and Y coordinate data from an Excel sheet and subsequently processing it to calculate an estimated Z coordinate using spatial interpolation methods. Interpolation is performed by considering the coordinates of nearby points in the dataset and applying techniques such as Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). The result is the determination of the Z coordinate at the point of interest, which can be of great utility in various applications such as cartography, geology, or three-dimensional data visualization.
This project provides an efficient solution for obtaining Z coordinates from X and Y coordinate data stored in an Excel sheet, making it easier to explore and analyze geospatial data in a familiar spreadsheet environment like Excel.
